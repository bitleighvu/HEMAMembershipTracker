# HEMA Membership Tracker

## About this Project

The HEMA Membership Tracker is a React-based web application that allows individuals to query whether or not a member is registered with the (HEMA Alliance)[https://www.hemaalliance.com/]. It is intended to help HEMA administrators to verify whether a designated person is registered with the organization based on their email address, and HEMA-approved vendors to determine if someone is eligible for a membership discount.

The project is integrating with the existing (TidyHQ backend)[https://dev.tidyhq.com/] to coexist with the HEMA Alliance technical ecosystem. Future additions could include paperless event tracking and waiver management.

## Running the Project

If you don't already have it, download and install npm on your device. Clone the project using

`git clone https://github.com/bitleighvu/HEMAMembershipTracker.git`

Next, navigate to the directory `hema-membership-tracker` and enter the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm start`

The project should be automatically opened in a new browser tab running on `localhost:3000`. This is temporary, and the project will eventually be hosted at the discretion of the HEMA Alliance.
